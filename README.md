# This game has the same concept as Rock Paper Scissors. 

## Start the game by clicking the button. The player chooses either stone, sheet, or knife in the prompt. The choices between the player and computer are compared, and the winner is determined by: 

## Stone beats knife.
## Knife slice sheet.
## Sheet wraps rock.
## If thereâ€™s a tie, then the game ends in a tie.

## Refresh the page to restart the game!

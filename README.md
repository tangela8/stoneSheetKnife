# This game has the same concept as Rock Paper Scissors. 

## The player chooses either stone, sheet, or knife in the prompt. The choices between the player and computer are compared, and the winner is determined by: 

## Stone beats knife.
## Knife slice sheet.
## Sheet wraps rock.
## If thereâ€™s a tie, then the game ends in a tie.
